## Digital Inclusion Challenge 2020
Lemons Live is a project for the Digital Inclusion Challenge 2020 hosted by Convergence.tech. The Challenge was held across the world, where we placed Top 30 out of over 1000 students across 30 different countries. 

# Lemons Live
With online learning, students often feel isolated from their peers and teachers. This causes a great increase of disengagement. As students disengage from the classroom, their learning starts to dwindle.

Lemons Live is a real-time platform for interactive learning. Through this software, teachers around the world are able to engage their students by creating online team competitions. 

Lemons Live uses a Socket.IO real-time engine on the Node,js, Express, and MongoDB stack to create a smooth and interactive experience for the user. We used Tailwind UI to create a simple and clean user interface that allows students to have an engaging learning experience.
